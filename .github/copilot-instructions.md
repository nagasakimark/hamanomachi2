# Phaser.js Block Programming Game

This is a web-based game built with Phaser.js featuring:
- Left panel: Interactive map with a moveable character
- Right panel: Block-based programming interface (similar to Scratch)
- Programming blocks: go straight, turn left, turn right, look left, look right

## Project Structure
- HTML file for the game interface
- CSS for styling the dual-panel layout
- JavaScript files for game logic and block programming system
- Phaser.js library for game rendering and character movement

## Development Guidelines
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- Ensure blocks are draggable and executable
- Character should respond to block sequence execution
